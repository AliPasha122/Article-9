Light pollution, the excessive and misdirected use of artificial light, is a growing global
concern affecting human health, ecosystems, and energy consumption. Despite technological
advancements, it remains unresolved due to urban expansion, poor lighting designs, and
lack of regulatory enforcement. The problem extends beyond mere inconvenience—it
disrupts circadian rhythms, affects wildlife behavior, wastes energy, and obscures
astronomical observations. This article explores a novel solution: AI-driven adaptive lighting systems that optimize
illumination while minimizing pollution
